CertificationAssessmentTracker
==============================

Tracks Certifications and Assessments per person and reports on all persons.


This project uses the Tomcat Web Server and uses the database MySQL and you must have a schema created called certassesstracker to run it. It will create all of the tables for you upon start-up of your Tomcat server. Each time you start-up your Tomcat Server it will clear and recreate your tables for you. You can enter all the persons you want and all the certifications and assessments per person. You must complete the entry for each person, certifications, assessments at the same time and then move on to the next person. Currently there is no update functionality but it is planned for the future.
